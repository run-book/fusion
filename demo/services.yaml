# Here we are defining all the services that are available in the system.
# A service is two topics in Kafka. One for requests and one for responses.

# The post processor will add the schema id and name
#   the name is the name of the schema in a way that the schema registry can find it
#   the id is the precise current value of the schema (based on the git hash)

# TODO rename to service_schemas
kafka_schemas: "service/<service>/<reqOrResp>" # This is the naming convention. So if look at the first entry in capabilities services.equifax_creditCheck.request or services.equifax_creditCheck.response
