# These are Camunda external tasks and correspond to blocks on the BPMN diagram.
# Here we say the default service to use for each task.
# This can be overriden at any level in the hierarchy. i.e. in the uk we could pick a different aml service.
# And in the uk for a carloan with a merchant we could pick a different aml service again.

# For each of these tasks at run time we need
#  - the topic name to send the request to
#  - the schema to use for the request (we record the name and the precise value using the id)
#  - the schema to use for the response (we record the name and the precise value using the id)
#  - the topic name to listen for the response on

# these details are filled in by the post processor so we don't have to do this manually


# Unlike kafka we have a chain of responsibility to find the 'right' task description. We start most specific. We use a different templating than the config story for task
# This is because in different countries/products we might choose to have a different service to implement the task.
# Consider tweaking this... the ${} and the <> is a little ugly. I am not sure if we want the two levels...
