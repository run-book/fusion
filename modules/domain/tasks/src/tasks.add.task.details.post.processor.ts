//Goes through the tasks and for each one
//   - find the service that will be implementing it in this case (already handled by the config: deals with localisation like 'globally we do this but here we do that'
//   - find the schema for task.request and task.response and add the details to the task (id and name)
//      -This is a lot of variation here.
//      -The schema could be different for different countries, products, channels etc
//      - We don't want to have customers explicit manage this. There are hundreds of permutations and it would be easy to make a mistake
//      - So instead we scan the 'relevant schemas' and if there is a local override we use that
//
// Dependencies
// -The 'relevant schemas' are defined in the 'where.tasks' field
// - The services are defined in the 'services' field
// - The code currently mandates that a request and response for those are already defined
//    - That's probably an error: couples this to early post proessing... fix if move to MVP
